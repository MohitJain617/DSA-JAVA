Types of graph:
1. directed
2. undirected

1.cyclic
2.acyclic

1.weighted
2.unweighted

1.sparse
2.dense

Ways to represent graphs:
    adjacency matrix
    adjacency list
    edge list


Graph problems:
    Shortest Path problem (from a to b)
    Connectivity (does there exist a path between node A and B?)
    Negative cycles (does my weighted digraph have any negative cycles? where?) 
    Strongly connected components (every node in that cycle can reach to every other in it)
    Traveling salesman problem (np hard) 
    Bridges/cut edge (edges whose removal increases connectivity)
    Articulation points (nodes "    "        "           " ) 
    Minimum spanning tree(mst) 
    Network flow: max flow (helps to find bottlenecks) 

basic traversals:
    dfs
    

    bfs
